                History of Favergamez
            </h1>
            <p>
                FaverGamez began as a small Newcastle toy store more than <strong>fifty(50)</strong> years ago, 
                serving generations of families with classic board games, action figures, and 
                puzzles. Over the decades, it became a trusted name for fun, creativity, and 
                togetherness in the community. 
            </p>
            <p>
                ith the gaming industry evolving rapidly, the board of directors envisioned a 
                new future. Inspired by the global excitement for the Nintendo Switch 2 and 
                its record-breaking 3.5 million pre-orders within just four days, 
                FaverGamez decided to invest in modern gaming experiences. This transformation 
                marks a bold step from traditional toys to cutting-edge video games, 
                blending the company's heritage with the future of entertainment.
